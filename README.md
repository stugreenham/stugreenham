### ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @stugreenham, a Senior Product Designer from Yorkshire. 
For the last 6 years, I've been working remotely for Hudl on some exciting projects in the sports analysis world across Web, iOS, Android and MacOS. On the side, I like to tinker with code, be it figma plugins, browser plugins or most recently learning how to build apps with SwiftUI.
